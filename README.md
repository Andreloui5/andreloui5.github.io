# Basic Portfolio

This site is designed to lay the groundwork for further study, while demonstrating an initial range of skills and competencies.

## User Story

As a web developer, having a current, professional, and well-maintained portfolio is exceedingly important.

I used bootstrap to create a basic, responsive websiteâ€” while still maintaining my own sense of design and flow. It is my hope that this initial webpage will serve as a functional building block as my portfolio grows.

## My Portfolio

This site features three sections: an [About Me](https://andreloui5.github.io/Basic_Responsive_Portfolio/#aboutMe), space for my [Portfolio](https://andreloui5.github.io/Basic_Responsive_Portfolio/#myPortfolio), and links for others to [Contact Me](https://andreloui5.github.io/Basic_Responsive_Portfolio/#myContact) with any questions or concerns they might have.

## Credits

In setting up this project, I closely followed the guidelines provided by the [UCF Coding Bootcamp](https://github.com/UCF-Coding-Boot-Camp/UCF-ORL-FSF-FT-11-2019-U-C).

I used [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) for most of the images on the site, with the notable exception of my headshot, which was taken by Cass Russell.

The hover effect I use in the portfolio section was found at, and lightly adapted from, [miketricking.github.io](https://miketricking.github.io/bootstrap-image-hover/#).
